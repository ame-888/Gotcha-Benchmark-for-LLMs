# Gemini Model Benchmark Scores

**Model Name:** gemini-1.5-flash-latest
**Date of Test:** [User to fill - e.g., 2025-06-23]

---

## CLOCK Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 as the automated benchmark script (`automation/run_benchmark.py`) does not currently implement image generation for this test. It only provides conceptual prompts.

**Observations/Notes:**
*   No images were generated by the script for scoring. Manual run or script update required for actual image generation.

---

## ENIGMA Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 based on user-provided information that the model failed all questions, or due to API quota errors preventing full test execution in automated runs.

**Observations/Notes:**
*   Automated runs were affected by API quota errors (e.g., HTTP 429).

---

## VISUAL Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 due to persistent API quota errors (e.g., HTTP 429) preventing test completion during automated runs.

**Observations/Notes:**
*   Automated runs were affected by API quota errors.

---

## LIPOGRAM Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 due to persistent API quota errors (e.g., HTTP 429) preventing test completion during automated runs.

**Observations/Notes:**
*   Automated runs were affected by API quota errors.

---

**Overall Summary & Analysis:**
*   The `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model's performance in this run was significantly impacted by API quota limitations and script capabilities. CLOCK test could not be performed by the script. ENIGMA, VISUAL, and LIPOGRAM tests were incomplete due to API errors, resulting in scores of 0 for these sections.
