# Gemini Model Benchmark Scores

**Model Name:** gemini-1.5-flash-latest
**Date of Test:** [User to fill - e.g., 2025-06-23]

---

## CLOCK Test

**Score:** EXCLUDED / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score marked as EXCLUDED as the automated benchmark script (`automation/run_benchmark.py`) does not currently implement image generation for this test.

**Observations/Notes:**
*   No images were generated by the script. Test excluded from scoring due to script limitations.

---

## ENIGMA Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 due to API quota errors preventing test completion (as per the last JSON run: 2025-06-23T20:57:10).

**Observations/Notes:**
*   The first prompt in the automated run encountered an API quota error (HTTP 429).

---

## VISUAL Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0. One prompt was answered ("That hand has five fingers.") and deemed incorrect. Subsequent prompts hit API quota errors (as per the last JSON run: 2025-06-23T20:57:10).

**Observations/Notes:**
*   The first prompt was answered incorrectly. Subsequent prompts encountered API quota errors (HTTP 429).

---

## LIPOGRAM Test

**Score:** 0 / [Total Possible Score]

**How scores were derived:**
*   Score set to 0 due to API quota errors preventing test completion (as per the last JSON run: 2025-06-23T20:57:10).

**Observations/Notes:**
*   The first prompt in the automated run encountered an API quota error (HTTP 429).

---

**Overall Summary & Analysis:**
*   The `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model's performance in the latest run (2025-06-23T20:57:10) was significantly impacted by API quota limitations and script capabilities.
*   CLOCK test was EXCLUDED as the script does not implement image generation.
*   ENIGMA and LIPOGRAM tests scored 0 due to immediate API quota errors.
*   VISUAL test scored 0 as the only answered prompt was incorrect, and further prompts hit quota errors.
