# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in improving this benchmark!

## Reporting Results
The easiest way to contribute is to run the benchmark on a new model! You can report your results by:
1.  Opening a new "Issue" on the repository.
2.  Title the issue clearly, e.g., "Results for GPT-4o".
3.  Include your scores for all three sections and, if possible, the model's exact outputs.

## Suggesting a New Test
If you have an idea for a new prompt or an entirely new test category:
1.  Open a new "Issue".
2.  Title the issue "Suggestion: [Your Idea]".
3.  Clearly explain the test, the prompt, the "gotcha" or skill being tested, and a proposed scoring method.

Thank you!
