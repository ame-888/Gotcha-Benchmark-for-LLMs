# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in improving this benchmark!

## Reporting Results
The easiest way to contribute is to run the benchmark on a new model! You can report your results by:
1.  Opening a new "Issue" on the repository.
2.  Title the issue clearly, e.g., "Results for GPT-4o".
3.  Include your scores for all three sections and, if possible, the model's exact outputs.

## Suggesting a New Test
If you have an idea for an entirely new test category:
1.  Open a new "Issue".
2.  Title the issue "New Test Category Suggestion: [Your Idea]".
3.  Clearly explain the test, the "gotcha" or skill being tested, and a proposed scoring method.

### Suggesting New Test Prompts
If you have a specific prompt that fits within our existing benchmark categories (CLOCK, ENIGMA, VISUAL), please use the following template when submitting it as a new "Issue". This helps us quickly understand and integrate your suggestion.

**Issue Title:** `New Prompt Suggestion: [Benchmark Category] - Brief Description`

**Body:**

```markdown
**Benchmark Category:** (e.g., VISUAL, ENIGMA, CLOCK)
**Prompt Text:**
**Correct Answer(s):**
**Explanation of the 'Gotcha' / Skill Tested:** (Briefly explain what makes this prompt a good test of reasoning, and what common incorrect assumptions it might elicit.)
**Source/Inspiration (Optional):**
```

**Example:**

**Issue Title:** `New Prompt Suggestion: ENIGMA - Feather Weight`

**Body:**

```markdown
**Benchmark Category:** ENIGMA
**Prompt Text:** What is lighter than a feather, but even the strongest person can't hold it for 5 minutes?
**Correct Answer(s):** Breath / Their breath
**Explanation of the 'Gotcha' / Skill Tested:** This riddle plays on the literal interpretation of "lighter than a feather" and the physical act of "holding." The gotcha is that "holding your breath" is a common idiom, and the answer is intangible. It tests for lateral thinking beyond physical objects.
**Source/Inspiration (Optional):** Common riddle
```

Thank you!
