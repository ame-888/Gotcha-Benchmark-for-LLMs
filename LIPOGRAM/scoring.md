#### 1. Constraint Adherence (5 Points)
*This is the most important criterion. Any failure here indicates a failure of the core task.*

- **5 Points:** Perfect. The forbidden letter does not appear a single time.
- **3 Points:** Near-Perfect. The forbidden letter appears only once.
- **1 Point:** Major Failure. The forbidden letter appears 2-3 times.
- **0 Points:** Complete Failure. The forbidden letter appears 4 or more times, or the model refuses the task.

#### 2. Grammar and Coherence (3 Points)
*This assesses if the model can maintain linguistic quality under pressure.*

- **3 Points:** Excellent. The text is grammatically flawless and reads fluently and logically.
- **2 Points:** Good. The text has minor grammatical errors or some awkward phrasing but is fully understandable.
- **1 Point:** Poor. The text is difficult to read, has significant errors, or is barely coherent.
- **0 Points:** Unacceptable. The text is complete nonsense.

#### 3. Creative Quality & Task Fulfillment (2 Points)
*This assesses whether the model "gamed" the system with repetition or produced a genuinely creative response.*

- **2 Points:** High Quality. The text is interesting, on-topic with the prompt, and avoids repetitive sentence structures or simple lists of words.
- **1 Point:** Medium Quality. The text is on-topic but feels uninspired, bland, or relies on some repetition to meet the word count.
- **0 Points:** Low Quality. The text ignores the prompt's topic or is highly repetitive (e.g., "A dog is good. A pup is good. A hound is good...").
