1. Two fathers and two sons go fishing. They catch four fish in total. Each of them eats one whole fish, and nothing is left over. How many people went fishing? 
2. A boy is in a serious car accident. His stepfather takes him to the hospital. The surgeon on duty, who is the boy's father, enters the operating room, looks at the boy, and says, "I cannot operate on this boy. He is my son." How is this possible? 
3. A man lives on the 10th floor of a building. Every day, he takes the elevator to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns, he takes the elevator to the 11th floor and walks down one flight of stairs. Why? 
4. A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at him. The man says, "Sorry to bother you, I was just thirsty," and leaves. Why? 
5. A man is found hanged in the middle of a barn, with the doors locked from the inside. The rope is tied to a beam 2 meters high. There is nothing in the barn except a puddle of water beneath him. How did he hang himself?
